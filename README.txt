This is a simple project that I did to develop a simple egg-timer device. The timer had to do one very simple thing: it had to count down from 3.00 minutes to 0.00 minutes and then beep. Consequently, I designed it to be very easy to operate. It had just one button - a very large, red one - that the user would press to turn on the device and start counting down from 3 minutes. Pressing the button while the count was already in progress would simply reset the count to 3 minutes. When 3 minutes elapsed, the device beeps for 1 second, and then switches to a low-power mode.

I used a 32.768 kHz crystal and a PIC16F84A microcontroller as the heart of the device, taking advantage of the PIC's low-power "sleep" mode so that one-button operation would be possible. There is no need for an "off" switch, because once it's done timing, it just goes to "sleep", where it consumes very little energy until it is awakened by someone pressing its big red start button.
